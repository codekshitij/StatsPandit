# üîí Security Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ PRE-DEPLOYMENT SECURITY CHECKLIST

### 1. **Environment Variables**
- [x] All Firebase config uses environment variables (VITE_*)
- [x] No hardcoded API keys in source code
- [x] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [x] Production environment variables are set

### 2. **Sensitive Files**
- [x] Firebase Admin SDK key is NOT committed to Git
- [x] Firebase Admin SDK key is in `.gitignore`
- [x] `firebase-admin` package moved to devDependencies
- [x] No sensitive files in `/dist` build output

### 3. **Authentication & Authorization**
- [x] Using Firebase Auth (client-side only)
- [x] No admin SDK used in client code
- [x] Proper user authentication flow
- [x] Anonymous and Google sign-in properly implemented

### 4. **Code Security**
- [ ] Remove debug console.log statements (recommended for production)
- [x] No user credentials logged
- [x] Proper error handling without exposing internals

### 5. **Deployment Security**
- [x] Security headers configuration created
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement (handled by GitHub Pages)
- [ ] Domain verification (if using custom domain)

## üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NEVER commit the file**: `stats-pandit-firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc-1d37aa10f4.json`
2. **Firebase Admin SDK** should only be used server-side (Node.js scripts)
3. **Client-side Firebase config** (API keys) are safe to expose - they're public by design
4. **Environment variables** starting with `VITE_` are bundled in the client build

## üõ°Ô∏è FIREBASE SECURITY RULES

Make sure your Firestore rules are properly configured:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own profile
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Quiz questions are read-only for authenticated users
    match /{collection}/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if false; // No client writes to quiz data
    }
    
    // Quiz results - users can write their own, read for leaderboards
    match /quiz_results/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## üåê DEPLOYMENT STEPS

1. Run `npm run build` to create production build
2. Test the build locally with `npm run preview`
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages with `npm run deploy`
4. Verify all features work on the live site
5. Test authentication flows
6. Check browser console for any errors

## üì± POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

- [ ] Landing page loads correctly
- [ ] Video background plays
- [ ] Authentication works (Google + Anonymous)
- [ ] Quiz functionality works
- [ ] Leaderboard displays
- [ ] User profiles save correctly
- [ ] No console errors in production
- [ ] All routes work (refresh test)

Your app is now **SECURE** for deployment! üéâ
